This is a WIP but may be used nonetheless. Does not currently find errors in species changing, only in Pokemon. High relability.

python pack_checker.py

It will report every error (FIX IMMEDIATELY) or warning (CONSIDER FIXING) that I have ever seen. Notice that it cannot detect CUSTOM MOVES if you have them and other intended things, or if you use a move that is not common at all then it will print a warning. Investigate before "fixing" a warning.

Thats it! Happy checking.
